      The following list of 8 things you should never 
      post on Facebook is a great place to start. Itâ€™s easy and tempting, 
      but if you want your content to be seen by more people or increase followers, 
      product or service sales, or simply drive traffic back to your site for increased revenue, 
      then it may benefit you not to share these types of posts with the general public. 
      If nothing else this will keep some surprises from being spoiled before they are revealed in season two of Stranger Things!
