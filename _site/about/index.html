			My name is Kiflay Teweldebrhane Yimesgen - 
			<br />
			<br />
			I graduated from Queen Mary University of London with an M.Eng in Electronic Engineering. Currently I am working as Web developer at <a href="http://www.attraqt.com/" target="new" title="ATTRAQT"> ATTRAQT </a> in London.
			<br />
			I mostly develop web applications using .NET technologies, C# especially. I also develop 
			interactive interfaces with JavaScript using standard practices, patterns and protocols. I am currently learning Ruby on Rails.
			<br />
			I have special interest in high performance applications, which is why I love .NET - Applications are compiled to their binaries.
			<br />
			<br />
			I play football every friday, attend .NET London meetups and develop software.
